    <h3>What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?</h3>
    <p>Http is a protocal for transmitting hypermedia documents which is designed to make communixation
        between web browser and web server.</p>
        <h3>Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?</h3>
        <p>HTTP is a stateless protocal because it doesn't recognize the state of the user.
            Once a transaction is completed, the connection between the browser and the server is also terminated.</p>
        <h3>Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP</h3>
        <p>Sessions in client-server protocols like HTTP have three phases:... The client submits a request and awaits a response.
             The server responds to the request by returning an answer with a status code and relevant data. </p>
        <h3>Describe the parameters on a get and post request.</h3>
        <p>Get and post method are used to transfer data GET carries request parameter appended in URL string 
            but Post carries request paramater in message body.</p>
        <h3>What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</h3>
        <p>HTTP response status codes is an indicator code which checks whether a specific HTTP request has 
            been successfully completed.HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate OK and browser not found respectively </p>  
        <h3>What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</h3>
        <p>HTTP cookies is a small piece of data that is sent by server to the user's web browser.
            The Browser can store it and send it back to the same server.</p>
        <h3>Why are cookies a security issue?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are a security issue because  cyber attackers can hijack cookies and get access to the browsing sesion.</p>
        <h3>Describe session hijacking and XSS</h3>
        <p>The Session Hijacking is the process of hijaking the session token by stealing or predicting
            a valid session token to gain unauthorized access to the Web Server. <br>
            Cross-site scripting (XSS) is the most hazardous and prevalent technique of stealing an online session. Injected scripts can acquire access to your session key if the server does not set the HttpOnly property in session cookies, giving attackers the information they need to hijack your session.</p>
        <h3>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.</h3>
        <p>The W3C standard Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) permits a server to loosen the same-origin restriction. CORS is not a security feature; rather, it is a security feature that relaxes security. Secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers are made possible via the CORS protocol.
             To minimize the dangers of cross-origin HTTP requests, modern browsers employ CORS in APIs like XMLHttpRequest and Fetch.</p>
